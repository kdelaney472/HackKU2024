# AllergiX
## A helping hand to detect potential food allergens
### Made for HackKU24
---

AllergiX is an application that makes use of web-scraping and AI image recognition to detect possible allergens in food.
To use it, you can either search a food item by text through the search box, or upload an image for AI detection.
AllergiX will attempt to detect possible allergens in your food by web-scraping recipe websites for common allergens, and AI image recognition will guess what allergens are present simply by looking at your food.

Currently, AllergiX supports 3 of the most common allergens: 
1. Gluten
2. Dairy
3. Shellfish
